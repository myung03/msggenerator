# Message Generator -> Mad Libs

## Message generator
- This was my *first personal project*, built using Javascript 
- It a function that creates a unique MadLib everytime the program was ran by forward looping through an array 
  and pushing a random word for each empty space
- was a fun project to start out on! Wanted to do something simple to get the ball rolling

## How to use 
- Simply run the program and a random message will appear in the terminal. Have fun! 

## Technologies 
- Written on VSCode using Javascript

## What I learned 
- Had a lot of fun trying things out and troubleshooting! 
- Learned that there are a ton of ways to do one task - just this one project probably had 10+ ways to complete
